is bounded.

You can learn more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotting_algorithms_for_the_Mandelbrot_set).

## How to build & run
To build this project you'll need to have specific Cross Compilers and Assemblers that you can install by running one of [these](https://github.com/mell-o-tron/MellOs/tree/main/A_Setup) scripts, and you can easily run it by executing `./run.sh`.
